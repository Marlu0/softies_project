This folder, `C:/Users/marce/Documents/Code/se_project/test_folder`, contains a Python script (`test.py`) and a text file (`test.txt`) containing placeholder text (Lorem Ipsum). The Python script defines a simple greeting function and then attempts to call it with an integer as input.

The error in the Python code is that the `greet` function expects a string as input for the `name` parameter, but it's being called with the integer `123`. This will cause a `TypeError` when the code tries to concatenate the string "Hello, " with the integer `123`.

Here are a few possible corrections, depending on the intended purpose:

1.  **Convert the integer to a string:**

```python
def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + str(name))

greet(123)
```

   This will convert the integer `123` to the string `"123"` before concatenating it with "Hello, ".

2.  **Pass a string as input:**

```python
def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name)

greet("World")
```

   This will pass the string `"World"` as input to the `greet` function, which is the expected type.  Any string is a valid alternative to `"World"`, such as `"User"`, `"Marcel"`, etc.

3.  **Handle different input types (more robust):**

```python
def greet(name):
    if isinstance(name, str):
        print("Hello, " + name)
    else:
        print("Hello, " + str(name)) #or handle error
        # Or raise a TypeError:
        # raise TypeError("Name must be a string.")

greet(123)
```

    This version checks the type of the `name` argument. If it's a string, it proceeds as before. Otherwise, it converts it to a string.  You could also raise a `TypeError` if you strictly require a string.
